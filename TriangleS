#the indexes P, Q, R can be anything, but equal. That’s what they meant by 0 <= P < Q < R < N.

#1.sort the Array
#2.to make a triangle:
#2i) We set the longest side of the triangle . Let’s say it is A[i]
#2ii) we need to find the two shorter sides that can add up to A[i], Obviously A[i-2], A[i-1 ] are the two biggest values that are left for choosing from. If A[i-2] + A[i-1] A[i] return true;
